# Bookmarkable-Searches-on-KissCartoon
Work around the stupod POST implementation for bookmarking and link sharing

**What this gives you:**

Use / bookmark / share links like `http://kisscartoon.se/?s=SearchTerm` to be able to bookmark searches.

___

**Recommendations:**

- Collect active running series in a bookmark folder and CRTL-Click that folder to search for all of them at once.
- Use keywords (Firefox, not sure about Chrome) to quickly search KC from your address bar, for example:

 Location: `http://kisscartoon.se/?s=%s`
 
 Keyword: kc
 
 to search for "test" on KissCartoon simply by writing `kc test`
